### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

[BuildSpace](https://buildspace.so/builds/ai-writer) project.

### FunFact

The below parts are generated using GPT-3!

### Introduction

This project is aimed at generating Linux commands using GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3), an AI-based natural language processing model developed by OpenAI. GPT-3 is a powerful language model that can generate text that mimics human writing. This project will utilize GPT-3 to generate Linux commands that can then be used to automate tasks and simplify system administration.

### Features

- Generate Linux commands using GPT-3
- Easy to use interface

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Run the project

### Usage

The project is simple to use. Simply enter the desired command and GPT-3 will generate the corresponding Linux command.
